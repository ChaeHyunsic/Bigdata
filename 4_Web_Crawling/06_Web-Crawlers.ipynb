Investing in children’s early years pays off both for their and their parent’s success in life, and their contributions to the economy and society—a multigenerational return. \n",

      "The school entry boost\n",
      "Studying a diverse cohort of 2,500 children through the preschool and early elementary years, we examined the benefits from enrolling in early educational programs—whether entering at 3, 4, or 5 years of age. The results are clear—enrollment contributes to students’ learning and development the year in which they enroll, and they enter the following year performing significantly better than peers without those prior experiences. We call this effect the “school entry boost.”\n",
      "Children get this boost at age 3, 4, or 5 as they first experience a program organized around educational and developmental principles. The boost is not trivial—closing half the skills gap between children from under-resourced environments and their more resourced peers or between racially minoritized and majority students. The boost is most apparent for early skills in language and communication, reading and math, and cognitive skills such as working memory and inhibitory control—all critical elements of success.\n",
      "The boost is most evident when children with early education experience start a new school year well ahead of peers who did not have that opportunity the year before. For example, students who attended a preschool program at age 3 were ahead of their peers as 4-year-olds at the start of pre-K. The boost at 3, 4, or 5 was similar across a range of racial and ethnic groups—meaning early education benefited all children—with suggestions that English language learners gained to an even greater degree.\n",
      "The skills boosted by early education do not fade out. Although differences between children with and without prior early educational experiences diminish, this is entirely because children “catch up” when they get the boost of coming to school for the first time. The boost is more likely to be sustained when followed by another year or more of high-quality learning environments.\n",
      "Early education programs boost learning through the experiences they provide in classrooms. We observed in programs and identified in classrooms that boosts can then sustain learning by stimulating, supportive teacher-student interactions and relationships and challenging learning-focused activities taught in a sensitive and responsive manner. These “ingredients” benefit children across racial, ethnic, linguistic, and income groups. And if children are fortunate enough to land in classrooms like these year in and year out, their learning is sustained. Unfortunately, few children are that lucky.\n",
      "Finally, we discovered that teachers’ emotional well-being matters for how well they can provide these elements in their classrooms.\n",
      "What do these findings mean for the policy debates underway?  \n",
      "First, early education programs are beneficial. Yet, there are gaps in their availability. Fully funding universal access for 3- and 4-year-olds would be a game-changer. It is time to welcome all 3- and 4- year-olds into school—a public system of appropriate, stimulating, and caring educational opportunities.\n",
      "Access to an effective early education opportunity is too often a matter of luck. It’s time to make it a guarantee.\n",
      "Second, public school systems should be held accountable for the quality and benefits of public education for 3- and 4- year-olds. Legislation should ensure high standards for curriculum, the classroom environment, and teacher preparation and training. Legislation should require public school divisions and state agencies to operate education for children ages 3-8 as an integrated, single system.\n",
      "Third, we must invest in the adults who staff early learning and care programs. Those (nearly all women) who work with preschoolers are teachers. Investments that elevate and stabilize the wages and professional stature of child care workers are a necessary component of a national strategy for human capital.\n",
      "For many of our youngest, most vulnerable, and most marginalized citizens and their families, early education can be a lifeline, just as it is for the more advantaged children. Access to an effective early education opportunity is too often a matter of luck. It’s time to make it a guarantee.\n",

      "The school entry boost\n",
      "Studying a diverse cohort of 2,500 children through the preschool and early elementary years, we examined the benefits from enrolling in early educational programs—whether entering at 3, 4, or 5 years of age. The results are clear—enrollment contributes to students’ learning and development the year in which they enroll, and they enter the following year performing significantly better than peers without those prior experiences. We call this effect the “school entry boost.”\n",
      "Children get this boost at age 3, 4, or 5 as they first experience a program organized around educational and developmental principles. The boost is not trivial—closing half the skills gap between children from under-resourced environments and their more resourced peers or between racially minoritized and majority students. The boost is most apparent for early skills in language and communication, reading and math, and cognitive skills such as working memory and inhibitory control—all critical elements of success.\n",
      "The boost is most evident when children with early education experience start a new school year well ahead of peers who did not have that opportunity the year before. For example, students who attended a preschool program at age 3 were ahead of their peers as 4-year-olds at the start of pre-K. The boost at 3, 4, or 5 was similar across a range of racial and ethnic groups—meaning early education benefited all children—with suggestions that English language learners gained to an even greater degree.\n",
      "The skills boosted by early education do not fade out. Although differences between children with and without prior early educational experiences diminish, this is entirely because children “catch up” when they get the boost of coming to school for the first time. The boost is more likely to be sustained when followed by another year or more of high-quality learning environments.\n",
      "Early education programs boost learning through the experiences they provide in classrooms. We observed in programs and identified in classrooms that boosts can then sustain learning by stimulating, supportive teacher-student interactions and relationships and challenging learning-focused activities taught in a sensitive and responsive manner. These “ingredients” benefit children across racial, ethnic, linguistic, and income groups. And if children are fortunate enough to land in classrooms like these year in and year out, their learning is sustained. Unfortunately, few children are that lucky.\n",
      "Finally, we discovered that teachers’ emotional well-being matters for how well they can provide these elements in their classrooms.\n",
      "What do these findings mean for the policy debates underway?  \n",
      "First, early education programs are beneficial. Yet, there are gaps in their availability. Fully funding universal access for 3- and 4-year-olds would be a game-changer. It is time to welcome all 3- and 4- year-olds into school—a public system of appropriate, stimulating, and caring educational opportunities.\n",
      "Access to an effective early education opportunity is too often a matter of luck. It’s time to make it a guarantee.\n",
      "Second, public school systems should be held accountable for the quality and benefits of public education for 3- and 4- year-olds. Legislation should ensure high standards for curriculum, the classroom environment, and teacher preparation and training. Legislation should require public school divisions and state agencies to operate education for children ages 3-8 as an integrated, single system.\n",
      "Third, we must invest in the adults who staff early learning and care programs. Those (nearly all women) who work with preschoolers are teachers. Investments that elevate and stabilize the wages and professional stature of child care workers are a necessary component of a national strategy for human capital.\n",
      "For many of our youngest, most vulnerable, and most marginalized citizens and their families, early education can be a lifeline, just as it is for the more advantaged children. Access to an effective early education opportunity is too often a matter of luck. It’s time to make it a guarantee.\n",

      "URL: Facebook's Libra 2.0\n",
      "TITLE: \n",
      "Almost a year ago, Facebook announced it would create a global digital currency called “Libra” in order to help the billions of people around the world who lacked access to basic financial services. The currency would be a “stablecoin” backed by a basket of sovereign currencies such as the dollar, the euro and the yen. The proposal provoked widespread skepticism about Mark Zuckerberg’s motives—surely financial inclusion was just a veil for data collection ambitions—as well as criticism that Libra would undermine the U.S. dollar and cause all sorts of other problems. But the proposal also prompted a number of central banks to initiate or speed up research on the possibility of official digital currencies. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the proposal was recently significantly modified, and because China has now begun testing its central bank digital currency, it is a good time to reconsider the proposal and to examine whether public or private digital currencies can help improve access to financial services. I preview my conclusions in the introduction, which are that we should create a reasonable regulatory framework under which Libra can operate. The competition in payments is a good thing, and Libra may have some positive benefits for financial inclusion.\n",
      "The New and Improved Libra\n",
      "In the first section of the paper, I discuss the changes to the original proposal and the extent to which they address the criticisms of the idea. The biggest change is that the proposal now contemplates a series of digital stablecoins, each backed by a single sovereign currency, such as the U.S. dollar, rather than a single stablecoin backed by a basket of currencies. The concept of a multicurrency stablecoin is still present but only as a “digital composite of some of the single currency stablecoins available on the Libra network.” This change addresses many of the practical problems in the original proposal and it should make Libra easier to use. It also could be seen as a scaling back of Facebook’s ambitions, for the proposal is now more like a PayPal with a different technological backbone than a competitor to sovereign currencies. While this may disappoint some crypto enthusiasts, it should reduce concerns about Libra undermining sovereign currencies or interfering with the execution of a central bank’s monetary policy.\n",
      "The second change is enhanced compliance procedures to address concerns that the network could be used for money laundering and financing illicit activity. The revised proposal says some aspects of compliance will be built into the system itself and will be automated; it also sets forth diligence and screening procedures that were absent from the original proposal. But whether these are sufficient will depend on the details.\n",
      "The third change is greater detail on how the Libra Association will protect the reserve of sovereign currencies that it receives in exchange for issuing Libra stablecoins, which addresses safety and soundness concerns. Finally, the original idea of transitioning within five years from a “permissioned” blockchain system to a “permissionless” system has been jettisoned.\n",
      "All of these changes are improvements, but they do not address all the criticisms that were made. In particular, the changes are unlikely to persuade those who disliked the proposal because of its creator, Facebook. Many have voiced concerns about Facebook’s power, its past record on privacy, and its potential ability to use or misuse the data generated by Libra.\n",
      "I focus on the wide range of regulatory concerns raised by the proposal—which include prudential, consumer protection, and privacy issues. I discuss the challenge of creating the proper regulatory framework, particularly because the United States has a fragmented financial regulatory system involving several different agencies, and the Libra proposal cuts across their several jurisdictions. I consider whether the Financial Stability Oversight Council could help address that problem. Ultimately, I suggest that our individual financial regulators need to work with Swiss authorities, where the Libra Association is incorporated, as well as regulators in other jurisdictions to design the proper framework. With respect to privacy and use of data issues, and the power of large digital platforms like Libra generally, these concerns raise much broader issues than Libra, and require a comprehensive approach that is beyond the jurisdiction of financial regulators. I also discuss the challenge the Libra Association will face in the implementation of financial sanctions: will it follow United States policy even if that conflicts with its ambition to be a global platform?\n",
      "Libra and Financial Inclusion\n",
      "The second part of the paper examines whether Libra can achieve its goal of improving access to financial services. The problem is significant not just in developing countries but also in the United States, where almost a quarter of the population is unbanked or underbanked. They spend 10% of their income just to use their income.\n",
      "Whether Libra can succeed in this respect will depend on a number of factors, such as whether it is easy to cross the “cash/digital divide”—meaning is it easy and inexpensive to obtain and use Libra. The robustness of the network—is it used widely by those whom the underserved must typically pay—will also be a significant determinant. Whether ancillary services such as small amounts of credit are offered may also influence usage.\n",
      "The United States has a variety of relatively fast, easy-to-use payment options that are inexpensive or free to the consumer, and some provide financial benefits to consumers (free 30 day revolving credit on a credit card if you pay your monthly bill, for example, though we of course pay for that indirectly because of the fees that merchants are charged). It may be very challenging for Libra and the digital wallets that provide services to get people in countries with highly developed financial systems to use a new system.\n",
      "While I am not an expert on financial inclusion and the paper is not a comprehensive look at the question, I also briefly consider the merits of other proposals that are currently discussed to address the needs of those underserved by the system, such as by moving to a truly “real-time”payments system, the Federal Reserve’s FedNow project, the FDIC’s Safe Account project, and the revival of postal banking.\n",
      "Nevertheless if Libra succeeds only in reducing the cost of global remittances, that would be of great benefit to lower-income people around the world, including in the United States. Global remittances were over $700 billion in 2019, with about 10% of that amount being sent from the United States.\n",
      "The Value of Chinese Lessons\n",
      "The third section examines the dramatic growth of the Chinese third-party mobile payments industry. I consider whether the reasons for its success are relevant to Libra’s potential and what we can learn from the Chinese government’s regulatory response to the industry. Third party mobile payments grew from around $20 billion in 2012 to $35 trillion in 2019, largely because of two companies, Alipay (affiliated with the e commerce giant Alibaba) and WeChat Pay (part of the social media enterprise, WeChat). Their growth contributed significantly to financial inclusion in China. \n",

      "The competitive landscape facing these companies was quite different from what Libra will face in the United States and other countries with highly developed financial systems. Cash was the primary means of retail payment at the time when the China third party mobile payments industry started to grow significantly. The United States has a variety of payment alternatives which work especially well for those above the lower rungs of the income ladder and which will mean Libra faces much tougher competition.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the experience of China suggests that consumers may adapt quickly to a new technology that offers greater convenience and savings. The Chinese companies made it easy for consumers to cross the cash/digital divide. They created robust networks and offered a variety of ancillary services. These included money market funds which allowed consumers to easily transfer funds from a savings product to their payment account.\n",
      "Chinese authorities took a number of steps to address the risks posed by a huge shift of funds from traditionally regulated banks to these new enterprises. The combination of prudential measures, consumer protection measures and other steps are similar to what regulators will need to create to oversee Libra.\n",
      "Will a Proposal for a Private Digital Currency Lead to Public Digital Currencies\n",
      "The most significant consequence of the Libra proposal to date has been to accelerate work on the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDC), and I examine this briefly in the fourth part of the paper. Many nations are now exploring the idea. Officials in many countries, including Chairman Powell of the Federal Reserve, have acknowledged that Libra has had an effect on this work.\n",
      "But the case for CBDCs is a mixed one. A so-called “wholesale CBDC”—available only to financial or other large institutions—might represent an improvement of existing electronic payment systems but is unlikely to significantly change how most of us use money, unless a broad swath of institutions are included. But in that respect, it seems quite similar to the initiative the Federal Reserve has already launched, called FedNow, to move the banking system closer to real-time payments. A retail CBDC might increase financial inclusion and might bring faster payments, but it also creates a risk of disintermediating the traditional banking system. That could have adverse effects on credit creation and on financial stability.\n",
      "China is the first major country to begin testing a CBDC. It seems that its primary purpose is not for financial inclusion or efficiency gains, but rather as a part of its efforts to make the RMB a more significant international currency. China as well as some European officials also see the development of CBDCs as a means to reduce the dominance of the U.S. dollar in international payments.\n",
      "To date, the Federal Reserve has acknowledged the importance of studying the CBDC issue but has not disclosed any plans to develop or test its own version. It is focused instead on its FedNow project to improve efficiency of payments.\n",
      "My own view is that while there are many reasons for the United States not to be a first mover when it comes to CBDCs, we should be actively studying the issue and considering options, particularly because the actions of other countries could force us to act.\n",
      "Conclusion \n",
      "We face decisions with respect to the Libra proposal, since the Libra Association is currently seeking approval from Swiss regulators to launch its service. And while there may be other ways to improve access to financial services, the fact is this innovation could lead to some improvements in payments and stimulate competition.\n",
      "That is why we should create a reasonable regulatory framework to manage the potential risks of the proposal and allow it to go forward. That means addressing prudential and financial stability concerns, consumer protection issues, money laundering and illicit activity prevention, as well as privacy and use of data issues. Our various financial regulators will need to collaborate with one another and with their international counterparts to stitch together the proper approach. But that is a worthwhile undertaking, because innovation of this type can be a beneficial force. And surely when it comes to access to financial services, we can do better.\n",

      "URL: Solving the problem of racially discriminatory advertising on Facebook\n",
      "TITLE: \n",
      "While Facebook profiles may not explicitly state users’ race or ethnicity, my research demonstrates that Facebook’s current advertising algorithms can discriminate by these factors. Based on research conducted in 2020 and 2021, I used Facebook’s advertising tools to test how advertisers can use their targeting options like “multicultural affinity” groups, Lookalike Audiences, and Special Ad Audiences to ensure their ads are reaching white, African American, Asian, or Hispanic users. What I found is that discrimination by race and ethnicity on Facebook’s platforms is a significant threat to the public interest for two reasons. First, it is a violation of the existing civil rights laws that protect marginalized consumers against advertising harms and discrimination by race and ethnicity, especially in the areas of housing, employment, and credit. Second, these same Facebook advertising tools can be used to disseminate targeted misinformation and controversial political messages to vulnerable demographic groups. To solve these concerns, regulators, advocacy groups, and industry must directly address these issues with Facebook and other advertising platforms to ensure that online advertising is transparent and fair to all Americans.\n",
      "Racial Bias and Discrimination in Facebook Ad Targeting\n",
      "\n",
      "Facebook’s long-standing complaints in advertising\n",
      "Over the last 5 years, Facebook has faced repeated criticism, lawsuits, and controversies over the potential for discrimination on its ad platform. Journalists have demonstrated how easy it is to exclude users whom Facebook has algorithmically classified into certain racial or ethnic affinity groups from being targeted by housing or employment ads. Researchers have also demonstrated racial and ethnic biases in Facebook’s Lookalike Audience and Special Ad Audience algorithms, which identify new Facebook users similar to an advertiser’s existing customers. In response to these allegations, Facebook has been sued by the National Fair Housing Alliance, the ACLU, the Communications Workers of America, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and others over issues of discrimination on its advertising platform and violations of civil rights laws such as the Fair Housing Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which expresses intolerance of any types of racial discrimination.\n",

      "There are also ongoing controversies over how Facebook’s platform can be used by political actors, both foreign and domestic, to spread misinformation and target racial and ethnic minorities in the 2016 and 2020 election cycles. In July 2020, a high-profile boycott of Facebook’s advertising platform to “Stop Hate for Profit” was organized by civil rights and advocacy groups including the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League, Color of Change, and other organizations over misinformation and civil rights violations. These groups called on major corporations to stop advertising on Facebook for the entire month of July. More than 1,000 large companies including Microsoft, Starbucks, Target, and others participated in the boycott.\n",
      "On July 8, 2020, Facebook released its own civil rights audit conducted by Laura Murphy, former Director of the ACLU Legislative Office, and attorneys at the law firm Relman Colfax. The audit criticized Facebook for having “placed greater emphasis on free expression” over the “value of non-discrimination.” Seeking to make concrete steps towards reducing discrimination, on August 11, 2020, Facebook announced that it would retire its controversial “multicultural affinity” groups that allowed advertisers to target users whom Facebook has categorized as “African American (US),” “Asian American (US),” or “Hispanic (US – All).”\n",
      "has Facebook sufficiently addressed discriminatory ad harms?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Not every case of advertising discrimination may be illegal. Keeping this in mind, I devised a research study and tested the degree to which the different tools on Facebook’s ad platform can—intentionally or not—carry out racial and ethnic discrimination, following the Fair Housing Act’s criteria which makes it illegal to publish an ad that indicates “any preference, limitation, or discrimination” based on race or ethnicity.\n",
      "To date, Facebook provides advertisers with four major ways to target advertisements:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Detailed Targeting” options are prepackaged groups of Facebook users who share common attributes based on Facebook’s data analysis of their behaviors online,\n",
      "“Custom Audiences” allow an advertiser to upload their own list of customers or individuals for Facebook to target,\n",
      "“Lookalike Audiences” allow an advertiser to reach people who Facebook determines to be similar to a designated Custom Audience, and\n",
      "“Special Ad Audiences” allow an advertiser to create a Lookalike Audience that finds people similar to their designated Custom Audience in online behavior without considering sensitive attributes like age, gender, or ZIP code, specifically for housing, employment, and credit ads which are regulated by anti-discrimination laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "I conducted my study in January 2020 and again in January 2021, before and after the Stop Hate for Profit boycott in July 2020. As Facebook no longer offers multicultural affinity groups – “African American (US),” “Asian American (US),” and “Hispanic (US – All)” – as targeting options for advertisers in 2021, I instead examined the similar-sounding cultural interest groups that Facebook still offered as targeting options, such as “African-American Culture,” “Asian American Culture,” and “Hispanic American Culture.” In both years, I tested how many minority users could be targeted by these race- and ethnicity-related advertising options by Facebook.\n",

      "I also tested if Facebook’s other advertising tools, such as Lookalike Audiences and Special Ad Audiences, can discriminate by race and ethnicity. For these tests, I used the most recent North Carolina voter registration dataset, which has voter-provided race and ethnicity information. In the North Carolina voter data, there were approximately 4.0 million white, 1.2 million African American, 90,000 Asian, and 180,000 Hispanic active voters. I created different racially and ethnically homogenous sub-samples of voters with Facebook Custom Audiences and then asked Facebook to find additional similar users to target for ads using their Lookalike and Special Ad Audience tools.\n",
      "While Facebook doesn’t permit direct demographic queries for a Lookalike or Special Ad audience, I was able to leverage the daily reach estimates of Facebook’s ad planning tool to indirectly observe the racial and ethnic breakdown of a given Lookalike or Special Ad audience amongst North Carolina voters. For example, a Lookalike audience based on 10,000 African American voters in 2021 had an overlap in estimated daily reach of 139,000 users with a sample of 1 million African American voters but only an overlap of 17,000 users with a sample of 1 million white voters. This indicates that African Americans were likely over-represented in the Lookalike audience, since when intersecting the Lookalike audience with a combined 2 million voter sample that was 50% African American and 50% white at baseline, I found that 89% of the Lookalike audience’s overlap was with African American voters and only 11% with white voters. I replicated a similar process for testing the demographics of Lookalike and Special Ad Audiences based on white, Asian, and Hispanic voters. More details on the methodology can be found here.\n",
      "Figure 2: Overlap of a Facebook Lookalike Audience based on African-Americans with race-based North Carolina voter samples\n",
      "A Lookalike Audience of 2.3 million Facebook users in the U.S. based on a customer list of African Americans had 139,000 users in common with the 1 million African American voter sample and only 17,000 users in common with the 1 million white voter sample.\n",
      "A major concern about algorithmic discrimination is whether computers are reinforcing the existing patterns of discrimination that humans have made in the United States. Social science researchers have found in employment, housing, lending, and other aspects of life, racial proxies such as one’s name and neighborhood can increase the degree to which human decision-makers discriminate. Thus, I used a frequently-cited computer algorithm trained on the names of 13 million voters in Florida to identify commonly used names for each demographic group and U.S. Census data to identify ethnic enclave ZIP codes. Then, I tested if using voter samples based on commonly-used racial proxies such as names and ZIP codes can affect the degree of bias in the resulting Lookalike and Special Ad Audiences. For example, would a Lookalike audience based on African American voters with common African American names and who live in majority African American ZIP codes be even more likely to over-represent African Americans above the 50% baseline?\n",
      "Facebook still has a discrimination problem by race and ethnicity on its advertising platform\n",
      "My research study of Facebook’s ad platform in 2020 and 2021 had three major findings. Facebook’s ad platform still offers multiple ways for discrimination by race and ethnicity despite the historic boycott it faced in 2020, and bad actors can exploit these vulnerabilities in the new digital economy.\n",
      "Finding 1: The racial and ethnic targeting options by Facebook were even more accurate in 2021 than in 2020.\n",
      "In 2021, certain racial and ethnic cultural interest groups that Facebook still offered to advertisers were even more accurate in targeting minority users than the old “multicultural affinity” groups Facebook retired in August 2020. For example, in 2020, 150,000 African American voters in North Carolina could be reached by Facebook’s “African American (US)” targeting option each day, which is slightly more than the 142,000 who can be reached by Facebook’s “African-American Culture” targeting option in 2021. However, there was a dramatic decrease in the number of white voters who can be reached by the same targeting options, from 428,000 in 2020 to just 109,000 in 2021. This means that in 2020, Facebook’s “African American (US)” targeting option was likely to reach nearly three times as many white users as African American users, while in 2021, Facebook’s “African-American Culture” targeting option became significantly more accurate in reaching nearly a same number of African American users while targeting 75% fewer white users.\n",
      "Figure 3: Number of North Carolina voters by race reached by Facebook’s African American related targeting options, 2020 and 2021\n",
      "The number of white voters in North Carolina who can be reached by Facebook’s two African American related targeting options decreased by 75% in 2021 vs. 2020, while the number of African American voters who can be reached by the same two targeting options stayed nearly flat over the same time period.\n",
      "Finding 2: Facebook’s algorithms to find new audiences for an advertiser permit strong racial and ethnic biases, which includes the algorithm that Facebook explicitly designed to avoid discrimination.\n",
      "Facebook’s Lookalike and Special Ad Audiences can be biased by race and ethnicity in both 2020 and 2021 depending on the demographics of a customer list that an advertiser provides to Facebook. For example, in 2020, a Lookalike audience based on African American voters in North Carolina had a sample share of 83% African Americans, which increased to 89% in 2021. Thus, these Lookalike Audiences significantly over-represented African Americans above the expected 50% baseline sample share (Figure 4). Similarly, Lookalike Audiences based on white voters had a sample share of 73% whites in 2020 and 71% in 2021, significantly over-representing whites above the 50% baseline. Other tests found that Lookalike Audiences based on Asian or Hispanic voters would also significantly over-represent Asians or Hispanics above the expected baseline share.\n",
      "I also found a high degree of racial and ethnic bias in testing the Special Ad Audience tool that Facebook designed to explicitly avoid using sensitive demographic attributes when finding similar users to an advertiser’s customer list. For example, in 2020, a Special Ad audience based on African American voters had a sample share of 83% African Americans, which decreased slightly to 76% in 2021 (Figure 4). Special Ad Audiences based on white voters had a similarly high sample share of 83% whites in 2020 and 81% in 2021. Finally, I also found that Special Ad Audiences based on Hispanic voters significantly over-represented Hispanics in both 2020 and 2021. This finding is especially problematic since it means that advertisers for housing, credit, and employment can use the Special Ad audience tool that Facebook has created for these legally protected sectors to pursue discrimination by race and ethnicity. This also undermines the goals of the 2019 legal settlement between Facebook and the ACLU, which required Facebook to create an alternative ad targeting solution for these sectors where an advertiser “cannot target ads based on Facebook users’ age, gender, race, or categories that are associated with membership in protected groups, or based on ZIP code or a geographic area”.\n",
      "Finding 3: Racial proxies such as names and ZIP codes can increase the bias of Facebook’s ad targeting algorithms.\n",
      "In both 2020 and 2021, the degree of racial and ethnic bias in Facebook’s Lookalike and Special Ad Audiences is higher when the ad targeting algorithm is trying to find users similar to individuals with racially stereotypical traits such as their name or neighborhood. For example, a Lookalike audience based on African American voters with commonly-given African American names and who live in majority African American ZIP codes had a very high sample share of 93% African Americans in 2020, which increased to 94% in 2021 (Figure 4). In the most extreme case, in 2021, I found that a Lookalike audience based on Asian voters with commonly-given Asian names and who live in popular Asian ZIP codes had a sample share of 100% Asians.\n",
      "I also found that using racially stereotypical names and ZIP codes can embolden the opportunities for more precise discrimination in the use of Special Ad Audiences. For example, in 2020, a Special Ad audience based on African American voters with commonly-given African American names and who live in majority African American ZIP codes had a sample share of 97% African Americans, which was even higher than the 83% sample share observed when testing the Special Ad audience based on a generic sample of African American voters (Figure 4).\n",
      "Figure 4: Sample share of African-American voters in Lookalike Audiences (top) and Special Ad audiences (bottom) based on lists of North Carolina voters with different traits\n",
      "The top chart shows how Lookalike audiences  based on African Americans significantly over-represent African American voters. They have a sample share of 83% and 89% in 2020 and 2021 respectively, which increases to more than 93% in both years when the Lookalike audience is based on African American voters with common names and in majority-African-American ZIP codes. The bottom chart shows similar results in tests with Special Ad audiences, which is a tool explicitly created by Facebook to address discrimination.\n",
      "What’s causing these research findings?\n",
      "Based on algorithmic discrimination research, it’s likely that a combination of multiple causes contributed to the biased outcomes observed in this study. One of the primary factors is that computer algorithms tend to replicate existing patterns and behaviors that already exist in society. Facebook’s Lookalike and Special Ad Audience algorithms are using the enormous amounts of data that Facebook has about its users in order to identify which users are most similar to one another and thus most likely to respond well to the same type of ads. When it comes to demographic groups, researchers have found that racial and ethnic groups tend to behave differently from each other online and that Americans tend to have very racially homogenous friend networks. Thus, users within a racial or ethnic group may appear more alike to one another in the eyes of Facebook’s algorithms than users in different groups to each other. However, this doesn’t mean that Facebook should facilitate the discriminatory targeting of racial and ethnic minorities with ads, nor that commonly-used racial proxies such as name or ZIP code should also influence the digital world created by Facebook’s advertising algorithms. After all, hard-fought civil rights laws in the U.S. have intentionally elevated society’s interest in reducing discrimination above the private interest of landlords, employers, and lenders to maximize profits through possible discrimination. It would be taking a step backwards to make new allowances for discrimination on Facebook simply because the decision-maker is now a computer instead of a human.\n",
      "Given these findings, policy makers have a role in mitigating the biases being activated by companies like Facebook and other advertisers reliant on online tools.\n",
      "Policymakers, regulators, and civil society groups should demand and require greater transparency by Facebook and its advertisers\n",
      "Clearly, at the heart of the problems, is the lack of transparency by Facebook to the public and to its advertisers about how its ad platform can potentially discriminate by race and ethnicity. This may be exploited by discriminatory advertisers while undermining the goals of non-discriminatory ones.\n",
      "For example, discriminatory advertisers may already know that the “African-American Culture” targeting option contains fewer white users than the “African American (US)” option Facebook removed in 2020. Discriminatory advertisers may also be using similar proxy variable techniques to the ones tested in this study based on racially stereotypical names and ZIP codes to create biased Lookalike and Special Ad Audiences. On the other hand, non-discriminatory advertisers may be unintentionally choosing similar targeting settings as discriminatory ones but are unaware of how Facebook’s ad platform is carrying out racially and ethnically biased targeting on their behalf.\n",
      "Facebook can reverse this lack of transparency by more corporate accountability, transparency statement, disclosure to advertisers, and robust anti-discrimination engineering. However, it’s vitally important that regulators, advocacy groups, and industry groups can respond to improve upon such outcomes.\n",
      "Recommendation 1: Require Facebook and advertisers to release their ad targeting data.\n",
      "Advertising platforms like Facebook should provide greater transparency about the way that advertisers are using their tools to target ads. Regulators can require Facebook’s Ad Library for political, housing, employment, and credit-related ads to show the relevant metadata for establishing a “robust causal link” for racial or ethnic discrimination lawsuits. This is especially important since the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) “Implementation of the Fair Housing Act’s Disparate Impact Standard” published on September 24, 2020 now requires a plaintiff to present evidence of a “robust causal link” in order to bring a disparate impact discrimination lawsuit in the first place. Facebook has begun to share relevant metadata for political ads with approved researchers in 2021, but doesn’t currently release any ad targeting metadata for housing, employment, and credit-related ads.\n",
      "Recommendation 2: Conduct regular algorithmic bias auditing of Facebook’s ad platform.\n",
      "Future civil rights audits of Facebook’s platform should test its technologies for algorithmic bias based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and other protected classes. In July 2020, Facebook released its first civil rights audit primarily focused on political speech, misinformation, and legal issues during the Stop Hate for Profit boycott. The civil rights groups organizing the boycott called for regular audits of Facebook’s platform. These future civil rights audits can build on the technical efforts by myself and other researchers. Ideally, if provided even deeper access to Facebook’s data and systems, these audits can go even further in examining why these racial and ethnic biases exist and how to address them. Since 2014, many large U.S. tech companies such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Twitter, and others have participated in the related norm of releasing annual workforce diversity reports. Federal regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can also audit Facebook’s ad platform for discrimination and use their enforcement powers to address violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.\n",
      "Recommendation 3: Design anti-discrimination solutions using the more effective “fairness through awareness” approach.\n",
      "Technology and technology policy need to move beyond “fairness through unawareness”—the idea that discrimination is prevented by eliminating the use of protected class variables or close proxies—in order to actually address algorithmic discrimination. For example, Facebook created the Special Ad Audiences tool as an alternative to Lookalike Audiences in order to explicitly not use sensitive attributes such as “age, gender or ZIP code” when considering which users are similar enough to the source audience to get included. However, my research demonstrates that Special Ad Audiences based on African Americans or whites can be biased towards the race that is more dominant in the customer list used to create the audience, just like the corresponding Lookalike Audiences.\n",
      "Statistics research has labeled this phenomenon as the Rashomon or the multiplicity effect. Given a large dataset with many variables, there exists a large number of potential models that can perform approximately to equally as well as a prohibited model that uses protected class variables. Thus, even though the Special Ad Audiences algorithm for finding similar users to a customer list does not use demographic attributes in the same way as the Lookalike Audiences algorithm, the two algorithms may end up making functionally comparable decisions on which users are considered to be similar enough to get included.\n",

      "There are public policy risks from continuing to implement a “fairness through unawareness” standard, which has been shown to be statistically ineffective. For example, the initially proposed language on August 19, 2019 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for its updated Disparate Impact Standard, would likely have wrongfully protected companies like Facebook from being sued for discrimination simply because its Special Ad Audience algorithm follows “fairness through unawareness” and does not rely on “factors that are substitutes or close proxies for protected classes under the Fair Housing Act.”\n",
      "Instead, the more effective approach is to use “fairness through awareness” to design anti-discrimination tools, which could then accurately consider the experiences of different racial and ethnic groups on the platform. Thus, tech companies such as Facebook would need to learn the demographic information of their users. One way is to directly ask their users to provide their race and ethnicity on a voluntary basis, like with LinkedIn Self-ID. Another way is to use algorithmic or human evaluators to generate that information for their anti-discrimination testing tools. This was the approach taken by Airbnb’s Project Lighthouse, launched in 2020 to study the racial experience gap for guests and hosts on Airbnb. Project Lighthouse used a third-party contractor to assess the perceived race of an individual based on their name and profile picture. In December 2009, Facebook researchers used a related methodology by comparing the last names of Facebook users to the U.S. Census’ Frequently Occurring Surnames dataset in order to demonstrate how Facebook was becoming increasingly diverse over time by having more African American and Hispanic users.\n",
      "The harms from discriminatory advertising on Facebook that target specific demographic groups are real. Facebook ads have reduced employment opportunities, sowed political division and misinformation, and even undermined public health efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. My research shows how Facebook continues to offer advertisers myriad tools to facilitate discriminatory ad targeting by race and ethnicity, despite the high-profile Stop Hate for Profit boycott of July 2020. To address this issue, regulators and advocacy groups can enforce and demand greater ad targeting transparency, more algorithmic bias auditing, and a “fairness through awareness” approach by Facebook and its advertisers.\n",
      "In July 2020, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg stated that its civil rights audit was “the beginning of the journey, not the end.” Faced with a long road ahead, it’s time for Facebook to continue down the path to create more equitable and less harmful advertising systems.\n",

      "Congress should not let this latest “Facebook moment” pass without meaningful action. Every day that passes without a baseline privacy protection law in effect is another day that not just Facebook, but a multitude of businesses, collect and use data generated from billions of devices. IBM estimates that the world generates 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day – that’s 2.5 followed by 18 zeroes.\n",
      "This volume will soon explode even further as data-intensive technologies power augmented and virtual reality environments (the “metaverse” to which Facebook’s new corporate name refers), and autonomous vehicles in the streets communicate with sensors that monitor traffic and pedestrian safety.\n",
      "It is past time for the United States to require businesses to use data responsibly and give individuals rights in data about them, safeguard that have been absent and that would protect everyone in America.  Every major democracy in the world has passed legislation to set boundaries on business data collection – and this month a new commercial privacy law took effect in China.\n",
      "After the Cambridge Analytica stories in 2018, several congressional committees hauled in Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for back-to-back hearings carried live on cable news. Since then, Facebook has been a subject of some 70 hearings on privacy, competition, content moderation, misinformation, security, and diversity and inclusion, with 17 Facebook-affiliated witnesses.\n",
      "Galvanized by Facebook’s sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica, Congress made a promising start on comprehensive privacy legislation. Leading members called for legislation, several introduced bills, and multiple committees and working groups got to work toward bipartisan legislation.\n",
      "When it came to the hard bargaining, however, the early promise waned. Even though flagship bills from the leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee had encouraging areas of overlap, bipartisan agreement stalled. Ideological red lines that have frozen progress include whether a federal law should preempt state privacy laws in part or altogether, and whether to allow lawsuits by individuals for violations of privacy rights.\n",

As privacy work slowed, Congress’ attention has turned to the many other concerns about Facebook and tech platforms, including their impact on children, free speech and disinformation, competition, and jobs.\n",

      "Google Glass was the first effort at commonly-available image capturing eyewear. I recall when, in 2014, the doors to the elevator I was riding opened and in stepped a young man wearing Google Glass. The unique-looking glasses were a giveaway. Fellow elevator passengers were a mix of wonder and wariness. I asked, “Are you shooting us now?” With a bit of an attitude, the reply was, “You got a problem with that?”\n",
      "Though an innovative idea at the time, Google Glass soon became just an interesting idea. It continued in some enterprise applications, but was not yet ready for prime time. Facebook’s new Ray-Ban Stories glasses appear to have overcome Google’s earlier problems: the devices are priced at about one-fifth of Google Glass, and look like the Ray-Bans Tom Cruise made famous in the movies. Back then on the elevator, we knew something atypical was afoot because of the geeky appearance of Google Glass. Tom Cruise cool, however, is another matter.\n",
      "Without a doubt, the Facebook Ray-Ban technology is impressive: two 5-megapixel cameras, three microphones, four gigabytes of storage, and contained not in a bulky or Star Trek-looking device, but in a simple pair of undistinguishable Ray-Bans. Simply tap the shades and the audio or video is captured. The addition of a small LED on the Ray-Ban Stories frame is supposed to let people know they’re being recorded. The product’s website reassuringly proclaims, “Designed for privacy, controlled by you.” The privacy issue, however, is not just about “you” as the picture-taker, but also “them,” those being snapped and recorded. That the secret snapping is associated with Facebook, a company not known for its respect of personal privacy, is not reassuring.\n",
      "The Evolution of Privacy\n",
      "This is not the first time the issue of personal privacy and covert photography has arisen. That history is illustrative of the evolving interpretation of what constitutes privacy. In the late 19th century George Eastman developed the Kodak mass-market portable camera. It set off howls of concern. Suddenly, everyone could have had in their hands the ability to capture anyone else’s images and actions without the other person’s knowledge or permission.\n",
      "No less a legal scholar than Louis Brandeis, who would go on to become one of the great Supreme Court justices, responded to the new Kodak with a law review article entitled The Right to Privacy. “Recent inventions and business methods call attention to the next step which must be taken for the protection of the person, and for securing for the individual…the right ‘to be left alone,’” Brandeis and Samuel Warren wrote for the Harvard Law Review. The article went on to warn that, “numerous mechanical devices threaten to make good the prediction that ‘what is whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed from the house-tops.’”\n",
      "Brandeis’ analysis seems quaint today when smartphones generate over a billion photographs daily. But replace his term “mechanical devices” with “digital devices” and “whispering in the closet” with the ability to photograph and record the conversations in an elevator without permission and to store and manipulate that information and the result is a brave new world.\n",
      "The Digital Conundrum\n",
      "Ray-Ban Stories illustrates the conundrum of the digital era: how the exponential growth in technological capabilities stretches the linear thinking of humans and their institutions—a topic explored in a new book, The Exponential Age, by Azeem Azhar. To become a modern-day Luddite is clearly not the answer. But neither is rolling over and not considering the consequences of the new developments. The issue is not repealing the digital revolution, but the establishment of public interest guardrails for its behavioral results.\n",
      "The amazing technology of the new glasses is a classic example of how digital entrepreneurs think. The question “can we build it?” supersedes asking, “what are the consequences if we build it and how can they be mitigated?” Facebook appears to have anticipated the need to address the privacy issue as a part of its product rollout, but the issues raised call for more than public relations.\n",
      "To Facebook’s credit, their Responsible Innovation Principles profess a commitment to “building inclusive, privacy-centric products.” The principles, however, push such responsibility off on the users. Principle 1 is “Never surprise people;” while being “transparent about how our products work and the data they collect” is a worthwhile goal, it does not prevent an unwanted surprise in the elevator. Principle 2 is “Provide controls that matter,” that “put people in charge of their experience,” which in this case appears to be the LED warning light. Principle 3 is “Consider everyone,” specifically, “we also need to consider people who aren’t using our products.” Principle 4 is “Put people first,” and is defined as being “responsible stewards of people’s data.”\n",

Beyond the lofty words, however, what will be done with the data that can be secretly collected?\n",
      "We have all experienced how Facebook and others harnessed the Web to siphon away our personal information – both virtual and physical – even when we are not using the product. Now comes the ability to have wandering collectors of data feed information into Facebook’s servers. To their credit, the company has said they will not use the data created by the glasses for its more traditional aggregation and targeting activities. The digital images and audio captured by the glasses are stored on the device rather than automatically uploaded to Facebook. The wearer makes the offload decision, but once made, the data still ends up in Facebook’s server when the user loads it on an app tied to that user’s Facebook account.\n",
      "“We take your privacy and security seriously,” the glasses’ website promises. Well, at least they’re talking about it. But this, of course, is the same company that in 2014 promised regulators it would run WhatsApp as a separate company, segregating and protecting consumer data, then—acting unilaterally in 2021—did just the opposite. This is a company whose business model is built on the use of personal information.\n",
      "Beyond Brandeis\n",
      "This does not mean some kind of heavy-handed regulation; but it does mean more than allowing the technologists to unilaterally make the rules.\n",
      "In the 20th century we moved beyond Brandeis’ fears about cameras. The 21st century, however, opens a whole new set of issues around the use of personal data. Facebook makes clear that the glasses are the entry gateway to augmented reality, describing them as “first-generation smart glasses.” We know what is coming: augmented reality and virtual reality.\n",
      "Rather than repeating what was experienced with the Web—awakening after the horse has left the barn—we should today be establishing policies for the use of the data that is created by the even newer technologies. This does not mean some kind of heavy-handed regulation; but it does mean more than allowing the technologists to unilaterally make the rules.\n",
      "The internet’s ability to spy on users caught everyone off guard in its early iteration. Facebook’s Ray-Ban Stories glasses now provide the opportunity to get in front of the issue of next-generation wearable technology. It is commendable that companies such as Facebook say they will be sensitive to personal privacy issues—but it is not sufficient. We have seen how companies’ “privacy policies” are less about privacy protection and more about invading a user’s privacy.\n",
      "Let’s take Facebook (and others) at their word about protecting individual privacy and develop federally enforceable behavioral standards for the use of the data that is created as we use these amazing new products.\n",

      "Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s testimony on the social media platform’s business practices may have been an eye-opened for members of Congress, says former FCC Chair Tom Wheeler, but this and other recent revelations are just the canary in the coal mine for the broader digital ecosystem. Wheeler points to a lack of government oversight that has left digital platforms to make their own rules, and what responses may be forthcoming from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, and state-level actors.\n",

      "TRANSCRIPT\n",
      "PITA: Last week, the U.S. Senate heard testimony from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen on the platform’s detrimental impact on children and young adults who use it. Questions about whether and how to moderate speech and content ranging from sensitive or misleading up to inflammatory and dangerous have grown in recent years, particularly around the 2020 election and the COVID-19 pandemic. So we’re glad to have with us today Tom Wheeler, visiting fellow with the Center for Technology Innovation here at Brookings, and the former chair of the FCC during the Obama administration. Tom, thanks for talking to us.\n",
      "WHEELER: Adrianna, it’s great to be with you again.\n",
      "PITA: So, in addition to Frances Haugen’s testimony, there has also been reports of a second whistleblower willing to testify regarding foreign national leaders’ manipulation of the Facebook platform. The Intercept published an internal list of banned or heavily restricted subjects, individuals and organizations that Facebook uses. So, Facebook’s not having a great week. This is on top of the massive system outage a couple weeks ago.\n",
      "So, maybe you can start us off with what did the Senate hear from the whistleblower last week and where does her testimony in the context of this larger conversation about misinformation and free speech on social media platforms?\n",
      "WHEELER: Well, you know, Adrianna, I think that what the Senate heard was a new context and an explanation for that context. The new context was to talk about the impact of Facebook’s business practices on consumers and specifically to single out the impact on children. Start talking about children and you get everybody’s attention, and you avoid a lot of the partisan “well I see it from this side,” “I see it from that side;” You talk about kids and everybody tends to see things in a much more similar way.\n",
      "But then the context that she put that into was to talk about the business model at Facebook. And that the reason that these kinds of harmful things were happening was because of a business model that prioritizes engagement over responsibility, that is designed to get as many people to stay as long as possible on the platform in order that Facebook can then sell as many advertisements as possible to those people.\n",
      "And she was very explicit in her statement that the priority is revenue generation, not the consequences of what may be being sent out. And that was, I think, an eye-opener for many of the people in the Congress and in the public that were listening.\n",
      "PITA: Facebook and Twitter have been around for a few years now, but digital communication does change so rapidly, that market and the technology. And federal policy is famously pretty slow to take shape and to take effect, partly because of the processes, partially because of ignorance on the part of a lot of lawmakers on these issues. So talk to us a little bit about what sort of response would you like to see? What would an effective federal regulatory policy look like around some of these issues of business models and content, and these issues that have come up?\n",
      "WHEELER: So the challenge, Adrianna, is how does government oversight become as agile as technology enables product creation to be? And where we have been on this, thus far, is that because of a lack of government oversight, we have been allowing the companies to make the rules, in essence to become pseudo-governments themselves, and to do that without concern for the consequences. What are the effects of their actions? What we need to have is a sense of agility in oversight that replicates the agility the digital technology creates for the ability to develop new products.\n",

      "Let me give you an example. The digital companies all move on standards. The standards process, saying this is how a technology will work, is a crucial process. We moved in mobile phones, for instance, from 1G to 2G to 3G to 4G to 5G and now they’re working on 6G as a technical standard that reflects the changes in technological capabilities, but nowhere along the line in any of the development of these standards was there consideration for, what are the consequences of this technical capability that we are standardizing?\n",
      "So what we need to be doing is to be asking ourselves the question, how do we have regulation that has the same kind of agility, but it is standardizing for the effects, the consequences, the behaviors, rather than the technology. And the proposal that myself and several others have made is that what we need to have is a process that takes and mirrors that technology standardization through a multi-stakeholder process, but brings the government into it to say, okay here are the kind of behavioral standards that need to be in place. We’ll be at the table while these get worked out and they can be flexible, over time, and then we will enforce those standards.\n",
      "PITA: You said that the platforms have largely been left alone to do their own governing, to do their own policing, setting their own standards. Is there a place in a more agile regulatory framework for the kinds of self-regulation, like, for instance, Facebook’s Oversight Board? Can those be effective, or those always going to be suspect because they’re the product of the company itself?\n",
      "WHEELER: Well, you know I don’t want to throw cold water on efforts to do the right thing, but it is unclear whether things like the Oversight Board have delivered much beyond being a public relations shield. The strategy at Facebook and other places seems to be one of, well, let us beg forgiveness, do a little bit, but not really compromise the cash cow that is this business model that is based on engagement and whatever it takes to keep the user connected for as long as possible.\n",
      "PITA: So Haugen is going to also be testifying before the British Parliament later this month. What sort of role is there for international coordination on these issues? Is that necessary? Are there mechanisms and dialogues sort of already in place on these issues? What does that look like?\n",
      "WHEELER: It’s a huge issue. The internet is a series of interconnected networks that don’t understand the lines that have been arbitrarily drawn on a map to say no, this is my country, this is your country kind of a situation. So the reality is that the rules that exist in one nation end up having an impact in other nations as well. And this is one of the real problems that I think will become increasingly apparent: that results from the failure of the United States government to step up and say this is how we envision regulatory oversight for these platforms, that the U.S. is behind what the European Union, the U.K. are doing to establish what, because of the interconnected nature of the Internet, ultimately become international norms.\n",
      "Give you one example. We have been talking forever in this country about privacy rules for the Internet. But the companies have been able to successfully block any legislation. The European Union came out with what they call the GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation. And when California, in the United States, decided they weren’t going to wait for the Congress and passed their own privacy law, what did they base it on? The GDPR and what the EU has done. So we are in a situation where instead of de jure deciding our own marketplace policies for the digital platforms, we are de facto defaulting to other nations’. And those countries might have different standards than we do. I mean, for instance, the EU and the U.K. see free speech much differently than we do. They see competition issues much differently than we do. And our absence from the field, our failure as a government to step up and do anything about these new digital platforms has left the regulatory field wide open to other nations who just might have decisions being made on other priorities.\n",
      "PITA: So these sorts of conversations, these questions about updating many aspects of internet and digital communications-related regulations have been around for several years. You mentioned at the top that you think that Haugen’s testimony will have a real impact because when it comes to kids that really gets people’s attention. So do you feel like we might maybe be at sort of a tipping point where we might finally see some congressional action on this issue?\n",
      "WHEELER: Well, I hope so, okay? And I also think that the Facebook stories – and, as you suggest, there appear to be more to come – are the canary in the coal mine for the broader digital platform space. That, yes, Facebook is taking it on the chin these days, often deservedly so, but it doesn’t mean that the other platforms end up getting a free pass.\n",
      "I think we’re going to see multiple forms of legal responses to what we’ve been learning. First, obviously, is regulation. And Lina Khan, the chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, has been very out front in in speaking about these things. We are going to see increased anti-trust enforcement, not only from the Justice Department and the FTC, but from state attorneys general. I think we’re also going to see some new legal action by both state attorneys general as well as private lawyers, representing private litigants, on the consumer harms that Frances Haugen laid out. And we’ll see some private actions in that regard.\n",
      "We’ve talked about legislation. The legislative process is a long and arduous process. I hope we end up with some legislation that creates meaningful oversight; hopefully, a new digital platform agency. But then the other part about it is that, as we discussed a minute ago, the rest of the world is not sitting idly by and waiting for us to make some kind of decision. By our inaction, thus far, we have abrogated international leadership, and so I think it will be a laundry list of those five things all working simultaneously, if not in concert, to redefine what the future ends up looking like.\n",
      "PITA: All right. Tom, thanks so much for talking to us and explaining this today.\n",
      "WHEELER: Adrianna, thank you.\n",
